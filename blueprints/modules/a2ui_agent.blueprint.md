# Agent SDK Development Guide

This document describes the architecture of an A2UI Agent SDK. The design separates concerns into distinct layers to follow a similar structure for consistency across languages, providing a streamlined developer experience for building AI agents that generate rich UI.

The Agent SDK is responsible for:

- **Catalog management**
- **Capability negotiation**
- **Prompt engineering**
- **Response parsing**
- **Payload validation**
- **Typesafe UI authoring**
- **Transport packaging**

It enables Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents to understand available UI capabilities and ensures that generated UI payloads conform strictly to negotiated specification contracts before transmission to client renderers.

---

## 1. Unified Architecture Overview

The Agent SDK architecture introduces a clear separation between **low-level single-responsibility primitives** and a **high-level application manager facade**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Facade["High-Level Application Facade<br/>(A2uiGenerator / A2uiRequestProcessor)"]
    Transformers["Catalog Transformers<br/>(Component / Function Allowlist Rules)"]
    Formats["Inference Formats<br/>(DirectJson / Express / More to be added)"]
    Parsers["Parser Engine<br/>(wrap, unwrap, compile, decompile, parse_response, parse_chunk)"]
    CoreModels["Core Data Models & Validation<br/>(a2ui_core Catalog, MessageProcessor & PayloadValidator)"]

    Facade --> Transformers
    Facade --> Formats
    Facade --> Parsers
    Transformers --> CoreModels
    Formats --> CoreModels
    Parsers --> CoreModels
```

1. **Decoupled Primitive Layer**:
   - **Catalog Representation**: Directly uses canonical `Catalog` models from `a2ui_core`.
   - **Catalog Transformers**: Standalone rule sets (`CatalogTransformer`, `ComponentPruningTransformer`, `FunctionPruningTransformer`) for filtering component definitions and function signatures from pristine catalogs.
   - **Inference Formats**: Strategy facades (`InferenceFormat`, `InferenceFormatFactory`) pairing format-specific prompt generators (`PromptGenerator`) and parsers (`Parser`). Supported strategies include `DirectJsonFormat` and `ExpressFormat`.
   - **Prompt Generators**: Format builders consuming transformed catalogs and prompt examples to generate system instruction snippets.
   - **Parsers**: Response extraction engines performing tag detection (`has_format_content`), tag unwrapping (`unwrap`) and wrapping (`wrap`), syntax compilation (`compile`) and decompilation (`decompile`). A format whose notation can be read incrementally also implements streaming chunk processing (`parse_chunk`).
   - **Validation Layer**: Reaches `a2ui_core` validation through `MessageProcessor`, which holds every active catalog, resolves each item to the catalog it belongs to, and delegates the item to that catalog's `PayloadValidator`. Protocol version branching (`v0_8`, `v0_9`, `v0_9_1`, `v1_0`) is handled by the core version adapters.
2. **Encapsulated Application Processor**:
   - `CatalogConfig`: Configuration dataclass pairing a resolved `Catalog` with the custom transformers to apply to it. A `CatalogProvider` (`FileSystemCatalogProvider`, `InMemoryCatalogProvider`) is how a catalog document becomes that `Catalog`, but the config holds the result rather than the provider.
   - `A2uiGenerator`: Agent-level lifecycle manager holding supported `CatalogConfig`s, generating pre-negotiated `A2uiRequestProcessor` instances per renderer capability signature.
   - `A2uiRequestProcessor`: Central processor facade object unifying multi-catalog capability resolution (`resolve_catalogs`), system prompt snippet rendering, turn-scoped parser creation, and response validation.

## 2. Directory & Package Structure

All SDK implementations of `a2ui_agent` must maintain a standardized directory layout similar to the Python SDK under `python/a2ui_agent/`.

## 3. Interface Specification

### A. Catalog Representation & Catalog Transformers

The Agent SDK uses `a2ui.core.Catalog` directly as the canonical model representing component definitions, function signatures, and theme schemas.

#### `CatalogTransformer`

Abstract base interface for transformation rules applied to catalog schemas prior to prompt engineering and payload validation.

```python
TComponent = TypeVar("TComponent", bound=ComponentApi)
TFunction = TypeVar("TFunction", bound=FunctionApi)

class CatalogTransformer(ABC):
    """Abstract base interface for transformation rules applied to catalog schemas."""

    @abstractmethod
    def transform(
        self, catalog: Catalog[TComponent, TFunction]
    ) -> Catalog[TComponent, TFunction]:
        """Transforms a Catalog into a modified Catalog of the same component and function types."""
        pass
```

#### `ComponentPruningTransformer`

Prunes catalog component definitions to an allowlist of allowed components.

```python
class ComponentPruningTransformer(CatalogTransformer):
    """Prunes catalog component definitions to an allowlist of allowed components."""

    def __init__(self, allowed_components: Sequence[str]):
        self.allowed_components = set(allowed_components)

    def transform(
        self, catalog: Catalog[TComponent, TFunction]
    ) -> Catalog[TComponent, TFunction]:
        """Returns a new Catalog filtered to only include components in allowed_components."""
        pass
```

#### `FunctionPruningTransformer`

Prunes catalog function definitions to an allowlist of allowed renderer-side validation rules and logic functions.

```python
class FunctionPruningTransformer(CatalogTransformer):
    """Prunes catalog function definitions to an allowlist of allowed functions."""

    def __init__(self, allowed_functions: Sequence[str]):
        self.allowed_functions = set(allowed_functions)

    def transform(
        self, catalog: Catalog[TComponent, TFunction]
    ) -> Catalog[TComponent, TFunction]:
        """Returns a new Catalog filtered to only include functions in allowed_functions."""
        pass
```

---

### B. Prompt Generation Layer (`a2ui.prompt`)

#### `PromptGenerator`

Abstract base interface for constructing system prompt instruction snippets across inference formats.

```python
class PromptGenerator(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for format-specific prompt generators.

    Attributes:
        catalogs: List of active Catalog instances to include in the system instructions.
        examples: Optional ordered list of prompt example turns. Each item is the list of
            AgentToRendererMessage objects making up one example turn, rendered into the
            snippet in the order given. An example carries no label of its own: what the
            model learns from it is the payload, so a description would be the prompt
            author's prose rather than part of the contract.
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        catalogs: Sequence[Catalog[TComponent, TFunction]],
        examples: Optional[Sequence[Sequence[AgentToRendererMessage]]] = None,
    ):
        self.catalogs = catalogs
        self.examples = examples

    @abstractmethod
    def generate(self) -> str:
        """
        Renders format-specific system prompt instructions and catalog schemas.
        The caller (Agent / Framework) prepends role/workflow preambles and appends suffixes.
        """
        pass
```

---

### C. Common Parser Package (`a2ui.parser`)

#### Response Part Structures

```python
@dataclass
class TextPart:
    """Represents extracted conversational text from an LLM response.

    Attributes:
        text: The conversational text content intended for user display.

    a2ui_raw: str

@dataclass

    Attributes:
        part: The underlying content, either conversational TextPart or uncompiled RawA2uiPart.

    """
    a2ui: list[AgentToRendererMessage]

ResponsePart = Union[TextPart, A2uiPart]
```

#### `Parser`

Base interface for response parsers across all inference format strategies.

```python
class Parser(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for response parsers.

    expressions into standard A2UI payload messages.

        raise NotImplementedError
```

### D. Validation Layer

Validation belongs to the `a2ui_core` package, and the Agent SDK does not maintain a
redundant validator wrapper. Core splits the work across two objects, and an agent
reaches validation through the first of them:

- **`MessageProcessor` (`a2ui.core.processing`)** is the entry point. It holds every
  active catalog, resolves each component and function call to the catalog it belongs to
  (the item's own `catalogId`, else the surface default, else the sole catalog), and hands
  the item to that catalog's validator. It also owns the checks that need more than one
  item: surface lifecycle, component uniqueness, root reachability, cycles, recursion
  depth caps, and data binding JSON Pointer syntax. A surface whose components come from
  several catalogs can only be checked here, which is why this and not the validator is
  what an agent calls.
- **`PayloadValidator` (`a2ui.core.validation`)** is scoped to exactly one catalog and
  checks exactly one item against it, through `validate_component`, `validate_function`
  and `validate_theme`. It cannot see a whole payload and cannot know which catalog an
  item belongs to, so it never decides routing.

Wire envelope structure is checked before either of them, by the core version adapter for
the protocol version the message declares. That is also where version branching across
`v0_8`, `v0_9`, `v0_9_1` and `v1_0` lives, so neither object above is version-aware.

See [`a2ui_core.blueprint.md`](a2ui_core.blueprint.md) for the full validation contract
and its implementation matrix.

#### Surface state during validation

A stateless check sees one outbound payload at a time, the agent-to-renderer messages the agent is about to send, with nothing else to compare it against. When that payload updates a surface it did not itself create, it carries no component tree, so a reference to a component the agent sent in an earlier payload cannot be resolved and is accepted.

An agent that keeps one `MessageProcessor` across a session and runs its own outbound messages through it holds that tree. References then resolve against the components the surface already has, and cycles are found across the whole surface instead of one payload at a time. The renderer runs these same checks when the payload arrives, so an agent that runs them first catches a bad payload before sending it rather than after.

---

### E. Inference Format Facades (`a2ui.inference_format`)

#### `InferenceFormatFactory` & `InferenceFormat`

```python
class InferenceFormatFactory(ABC):
    """Abstract interface for constructing InferenceFormat strategies bound to active catalogs."""

    @abstractmethod
    def create_format(
        self,
        catalogs: Sequence[Catalog[TComponent, TFunction]],

    ) -> "InferenceFormat":
        """Constructs an InferenceFormat instance bound to the provided active catalogs.

            examples: Optional list of few-shot example turns, each a list of messages.

        Returns:
            An InferenceFormat strategy instance.
        """
        pass

class InferenceFormat(ABC):
    """Coordinator facade pairing a prompt generator (input) and parser (output) for a format."""

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def prompt_generator(self) -> PromptGenerator:
        """Returns the format prompt generator instance."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def create_parser(self) -> Parser:
        """Creates a new parser instance bound to this format strategy."""
        pass
```

---

### F. High-Level Application Facade (`a2ui.processor`)

#### Catalog Providers

A provider can be constructed with a catalog id and a protocol version. Each is both a
default and an assertion: when the document states the same field, the two must agree or
the load fails; when the document states nothing, the provider's value is used, and the
resulting catalog is no different from one that carried its own.

Neither field has a fallback default. A load fails when nothing names the catalog, since
nothing could then address it in `supportedCatalogIds` or `createSurface`, and it fails
when nothing states a version, since a document read under the wrong version
mis-validates every payload written against it. This is what the notes below about
`catalog_id` being undefined in v0.8 and `protocol_version` being undefined before v1.0
imply: a provider value would otherwise be useless for exactly the documents that need it
most.

Every failure a provider raises is a catalog error, whether it comes from a file that is
not there, a document that is not JSON, a declaration conflicting with the document, or
an id or version nobody stated.

```python
class CatalogProvider(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for loading catalog definitions."""

### G. Utility Helpers (`a2ui.utils`)

#### `resolve_catalogs` (`a2ui.utils.catalog_resolver`)

Negotiates renderer capabilities against a registered sequence of catalogs (`Sequence[CatalogConfig]`) to select matching active schemas for a session.

`A2uiRendererCapabilities` comes from `a2ui_core` and is a multi-version union, the same way `AgentToRendererMessage` is: it covers each supported protocol version's capabilities shape, including the v0.9 `A2uiClientCapabilities`. An agent that supports more than one protocol version accepts any member of that union here and must not assume the v1.0 shape.

```python
def resolve_catalogs(
    catalogs: Sequence[CatalogConfig],
    renderer_capabilities: A2uiRendererCapabilities,
    accepts_inline_catalogs: bool = False,
) -> list[Catalog[TComponent, TFunction]]:
    """Matches renderer capabilities against registered catalogs and returns active transformed Catalog objects.

    Resolution follows these rules:

    - A present but empty `supportedCatalogIds` with no inline catalogs raises a catalog
      error, because the renderer has said it can render nothing.
    - Active catalogs come back in the renderer's preference order rather than the
      agent's registration order, so the renderer's first choice is the first catalog
      the model reads about.

    The catalogs returned are the transformed ones, so a pruning transformer is visible
    both in the prompt snippet and in what the processor will later accept.
    """
    pass
```

---

### H. Typesafe Builder API (`a2ui.builder`)

The builder API is the authoring counterpart to the inference formats. Where a format asks a model to emit A2UI, the builder lets application code construct it directly, with the catalog's component and function set expressed as native types so that a mistake is a compile-time or construction-time error rather than a rejected payload.

It is organised as a hand-written runtime plus generated catalog modules:

```
a2ui/builder/
├── core/                      # Version-independent authoring runtime
│   ├── base_node              # ComponentBuilderNode, ComponentRef
│   ├── child                  # Child slot annotation, FlattenContext, serializer
│   ├── id_allocator           # Deterministic component ID allocation
│   ├── open_enum              # OPEN_ENUM metadata and lenient parsing context
│   ├── flattener              # flatten_component_tree entry point
│   └── tree                   # ComponentTree aggregate
└── <version>/                 # One package per protocol version (e.g. v0_9)
    ├── models                 # DataBinding, FunctionCall, Action, CheckRule, ChildList
    ├── envelopes              # create_surface, update_components, typed messages
    └── catalogs/              # GENERATED: one module per catalog
```

#### Authoring model

A builder tree is nested; the wire format is flat. Every component references its children by ID and appears as a sibling in a single component list. The transformation between the two is the builder's only real behaviour, and it is attached to the child slot type rather than implemented as a separate traversal, so that the serialization library drives a single walk of the tree.

Authoring is strict and parsing is lenient on request: unknown properties are rejected at construction and enum properties are declared as the exact value set the catalog defines, while an explicit lenient context allows a parse to accept a value from a newer catalog revision without widening the declared type.

Catalog modules under `<version>/catalogs/` are generated from the catalog JSON schema by the A2UI CLI and are never edited by hand. Only the runtime in `core/` and `<version>/` is written directly.

The builder API is an optional capability, and a binding is useful without one. Its requirements, the generator contract, and the reasoning behind each rule are specified in the [Typesafe Builder API feature blueprint](../features/typesafe_builder_api.blueprint.md). Implementations claim it by listing `typesafe_builder_api` under `implemented_features` in their codebase blueprint.

### B. EXPRESS Format (`a2ui.inference_formats.express`)

Compact functional DSL format designed to reduce output token consumption, enclosed in `<a2ui>` sentinel tags. For formal grammar and syntax specification, see [Express Specification](../../specification/proposals/express/a2ui_express.md) and [Express Grammar](../../specification/inference_formats/express/Express.g4).

The Express format package under `a2ui/inference_formats/express/` contains:

- `format`: `ExpressFormatFactory` (subclassing `InferenceFormatFactory`) and `ExpressFormat` (subclassing `InferenceFormat`).
- `prompt_generator`: `ExpressPromptGenerator` (subclassing `PromptGenerator`), rendering compact positional signatures for catalog components and functions into prompt instructions.
- `compiler`: `ExpressCompiler`, lexing and parsing the DSL expressions found between `<a2ui>` tags into standard `AgentToRendererMessage` list structures.
- `decompiler`: `ExpressDecompiler`, converting `AgentToRendererMessage` payload lists back into Express DSL string format.
- `parser`: `ExpressParser` (subclassing `Parser`), delegating compilation and decompilation to `ExpressCompiler` and `ExpressDecompiler`.

Express does not stream. `ExpressParser.supports_streaming` is False and it does not implement `parse_chunk`: an Express block resolves references across its whole body, so a partial block names components that are not yet defined and cannot be compiled into anything. An agent using Express buffers the response and parses it whole.

## 5. Agent Workflow & Execution Walkthroughs

### Code Example

```python
# 1. Agent Startup: Initialize long-lived A2uiGenerator with agent catalogs.
#    Note: Prompt examples passed here are validated internally during processor creation
#    (create_processor) against active negotiated catalogs, raising A2uiValidationError if
#    any example uses components or structures not supported by the active catalog.
generator = A2uiGenerator(
    catalogs=[
        CatalogConfig(BasicCatalog("v1.0")),
        CatalogConfig.from_path("./catalogs/custom_catalog.json"),
    ],
    examples=load_examples("./prompts/examples/**")
)

# 2. In Request Handler: Retrieve pre-negotiated A2uiRequestProcessor matching renderer capabilities
processor = generator.create_processor(renderer_capabilities)

# 3. Invoke LLM to generate the output
llm_output_text = myagent.call_llm(processor.prompt_snippet, request_context)

# 4. Parse and validate output using the processor
response_parts = processor.parse_response(llm_output_text)

# 5. Deliver A2UI payloads to the renderer
```

## 6. Conformance Test Plan

To ensure behavioral parity across all SDK implementations (Python, Kotlin, etc.), the project maintains a language-agnostic conformance suite.

The suites covering this document live under `conformance/agent/`:

| Suite                                 | Covers                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<format>/compiler.yaml`              | `Parser.compile`: what a block of that format means                                             |
| `<format>/decompiler.yaml`            | `Parser.decompile`: how messages are written back into that format                              |
| `<format>/response_parser.yaml`       | `Parser.wrap`, `unwrap` and `parse_response`: where a payload begins and ends                   |
| `<format>/prompt_generator.yaml`      | `PromptGenerator.generate`: what the system prompt snippet has to tell the model                |
| `direct_json/response_streaming.yaml` | `Parser.parse_chunk`, for the one format that streams                                           |
| `catalog_provider.yaml`               | `CatalogProvider.load` and the checks it makes on a document                                    |
| `request_processor.yaml`              | `InferenceFormatFactory.create_format`, `A2uiGenerator.create_processor` and `resolve_catalogs` |

There is no `express/response_streaming.yaml`, because Express does not stream. Suites under `conformance/agent/legacy/` describe the earlier interface still implemented by `agent_sdks/python/a2ui_agent` and `kotlin/agent_sdk_legacy`, and stay until those SDKs move to the interface above.

Where a suite fixes something this document leaves open, the decision is stated in that suite's header rather than left for a reader to infer from the cases.

For complete setup instructions, test harness requirements, suite descriptions, and schema definitions, see [Conformance README](../../conformance/README.md).
