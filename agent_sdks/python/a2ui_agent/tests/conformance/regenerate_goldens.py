"""Regenerates the builder conformance goldens, refusing to write an invalid one.

Run from the repository root::

    uv run --project agent_sdks/python/a2ui_agent \\
        python3 agent_sdks/python/a2ui_agent/tests/conformance/regenerate_goldens.py

The validation gate is the point of this script. Regenerating from implementation
output and then asserting against the result makes a golden agree with whatever
the implementation does, bugs included; that is how the ``functionCall`` and
``DynamicChildList`` wire bugs reached review. Gating on the A2UI validator means
a golden can only be recorded if it is something a client could actually render.
