"""Child slot type used by generated catalogs, plus its Pydantic serializer.

A2UI is a flat wire format: a component references its children by ID, and every
component is emitted as a sibling in a single list. Builders are the opposite -
authors nest child objects inside their parents.

Rather than reflecting over builder objects after the fact, the tree-to-flat-list
transformation is attached to the child slot type itself. Any field annotated
:data:`Child` serializes to the child's allocated component ID and emits the child
subtree into the surrounding flatten pass as a side effect. Everything else
(aliases, defaults, ``exclude_none``, unions, nested models) stays Pydantic's job.
