    Traversal is Pydantic's: this sets up the ID allocator and then hands off to
    ``model_dump``, which drives the :data:`~.child.Child` serializer. This
    function is only responsible for the two things that are genuinely not
    field-level concerns:

    1. Anchoring the returned root to ``root_id`` so an independently authored
       subtree stitches into the caller's surface at a known address.
    2. Namespacing every sub-component as ``f"{root_id}__{local_id}"`` so two
       expansions of the same subtree cannot collide.

    Slot boundaries (:class:`ComponentRef`) are referenced by
    their original ID and never namespaced or re-emitted.
