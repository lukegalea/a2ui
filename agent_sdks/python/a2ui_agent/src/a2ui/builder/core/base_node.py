    Referenced components are addressed strictly by ID. They are never given a

    address the caller knows stays valid, and they are never emitted as
    components because the surface already holds them. Both behaviours live in
    the child slot serializer.

    ``component`` is left at its empty default. A reference is not a component
    and never reaches the wire as one, so naming a component type here would
    describe something that does not exist in any catalog.
